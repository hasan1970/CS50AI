This is an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait. Given information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have a particular observable trait (e.g. hearing loss) caused by a given gene, your AI will infer the probability distribution for each personâ€™s genes, as well as the probability distribution for whether any person will exhibit the trait in question.
